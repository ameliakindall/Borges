# Borges 
This is an automated test suite I created using Javascript and Cypress to test a demo ecommerce site. This is a personal project that I created to demonstrate some of the automated testing work that I've done in my previous roles, and more importantly, so I can continue to experiment and learn more about my favorite automated testing framework!

# What's up with the name?
Jorge Luis Borges was an Argentine writer of strange, labyrinthine little metafictions and poems that have absolutely nothing to do with code, automated testing, or my career but I adore them nonetheless. This breaks the rules of meaningful and descriptive names for repositories, but the name makes me happy when I see it, and to me, that's worth risking incoherence.
